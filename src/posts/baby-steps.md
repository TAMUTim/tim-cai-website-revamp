There is a point in every Software Engineer's life, a bit like a mid-life crisis,
where you are convinced that making a personal website will somehow solve all your problems.
For me, that point was around a month ago, and behold! This website was born!
I took heavy inspiration from the great [Anthony Fu](http://www.antfu.me) and his
ever-so-clean and polished website. Some may say I've gone too far (it's essentially a direct copy),
but I say I have not gone far enough! There are a couple of features that his has that I want to include in mine;
however, due to a different tech stack (and skill difference), it just isn't working.
I'll break those down in a second, but first I want to give a quick introduction to how I went about creating the site!
