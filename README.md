# Tim's Website Revamp

### So for a while, I've thought my website looked a little ragged. It was a little basic and it didn't really provide any challenges in terms of constructing it that made me proud of it, so with some free time on my hand, I've decided to revamp my website in svelte!

## Technologies
### The main packages used were:
 - p5-svelte | for graphics
 - svelte | as framework
 - nprogress | as loading bar
 - tailwindcss | as css framework
